    %h2 Goals and motivation of the project
    %ul
      %li feasibility of phase contrast on tubes with \(>100\) kVp
      %li characterize physical quantities
      %li typical environment for medical, security and material science applications

  %section
    %h2 On previous episodes
    %ul
      %li same differential phase signal as for lower energies
      %li best design \(\approx 60\) keV \(\pi\) shift
      %li (?) different dark-field signal, related to Compton scattering

  %section
    %h2 Different dark-field?

      "Collisions with gas molecules localize the molecular center-of-mass

      pattern."

    %p
      "Fringe visibility vs methane gas pressure on a semilogarithmic scale.
      The exponential decay indicates that each collision leads to a complete
      loss of coherence."

  %section
    %h2 Main feature
    %ul
      %li
        for a thickness \(t\) of a material with electron density \(n\), the
        visibility drops exponentially if each collision implies complete loss
        of coherence:
        \\[
        V(t) = V(0)\exp(-\sigma_{\text{eff}}nt)
        \\]
      %li
        "the relevant long range coherences are destroyed completely and
        independently of the separation [of the sample from \(G_1\)]"

    %h2 Theoretical background
    %ul
      %li
        The derivations in Hornberger et al have to be done from scratch for
        our case (massless photons, compton scattering)
      %li
        One important assumption is apparently broken: "[our experiment] is
        based on a Talbot-Lau interferometer with a wide acceptance angle.
        Consequently, a fullerene molecule still enters the detector after a
        typical collision."

  %section
    %h2 Outline
    %ul
      %li The experiments match in all respects, encouraging a development of a similar theory
      %li The theories are based on very different behaviours, with (loss of) coherence in common
